 1. Land Selection:

Choose well-drained, sandy loam or loam soil with good fertility. Groundnuts prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH of 6.0-7.0.
Ensure the land receives full sunlight.
</p>
<p>
2. Variety Selection:

Select groundnut varieties suited to your region's climate and intended use (oil extraction or nut production). Consult local agricultural experts or your nearest agricultural extension office for recommendations.
</p>
<p>
3. Soil Preparation:

Clear the land of weeds, rocks, and debris.
Plow the field to a depth of 15-20 cm (6-8 inches) and then harrow it to create a fine seedbed.
</p>
<p>
4. Seed Selection and Treatment:

Obtain high-quality groundnut seeds from a reputable source.
Treat the seeds with appropriate fungicides or pesticides to protect against seed-borne diseases.
</p>
<p>
5. Planting:

Plant groundnut seeds in rows or beds. The recommended spacing varies depending on the variety, but a common spacing is about 20-30 cm (8-12 inches) between plants and 45-60 cm (18-24 inches) between rows.
Plant the seeds at a depth of about 2-5 cm (1-2 inches).
</p>
<p>
6. Fertilization:

Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient deficiencies and apply fertilizers accordingly. Groundnuts require moderate amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
Apply well-rotted compost or organic matter to improve soil fertility.
</p>
<p>
7. Irrigation:

Provide consistent irrigation, especially during the flowering and pod development stages.
Avoid over-watering, as groundnuts are sensitive to waterlogging.
</p>
<p>
8. Weed Control:

Keep the groundnut field free of weeds, which can compete for nutrients, water, and sunlight.
Use mulch, manual weeding, or herbicides to control weeds.
</p>
<p>
9. Disease and Pest Management:

Monitor the groundnut crop for signs of diseases such as leaf spot and pests like aphids.
Apply appropriate pesticides or integrated pest management strategies as needed.
